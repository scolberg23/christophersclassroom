    <p>Everyone learns differently in different classroom environments. The book <i>the curious incident of the dog in
        the nighttime</i>, a novel by Mark Haddon, highlights this through the main character Christopher. Christopher
      is a kid with autism that has trouble in social environments. He is very strong at math but doesn’t like meeting
      new people or being touched. I designed a new classroom that aims to solve many of these problems. The desks are
      spaced apart in a way that no student is disturbed and there are noise-canceling headphones available to the
      students. This classroom is designed to enhance everyone's learning experience with specially designed desks, a
      cozy corner, a movie theatre-like media room, an outside area, and more.

    <p>One of the features of the room is a corner where the students can practice their work, improving their
      strengths. This can be anything from math to English to language. For math, the corner has ipads with multiple
      math practice apps such as solve me mobiles and i-ready. The built-in fish tank and beanbag chairs are made
      purposefully to make the space more comfortable for anyone. If the student wants a break, they can go to the
      corner at any time during a class period to quietly work on their classwork or practice their strengths. For
      Christopher, math makes him comfortable in awkward situations. He uses math as a tool to be able to calm himself
      down; “I doubled 2’s in my head because it made me feel calmer. I got to 33554432, which is 225 which was not very 
      much because I’ve got to 245 before, but my brain wasn’t working very well.” (Haddon 120). This can help kids with
      multiple intelligences because it doesn’t just have to be math, there are many apps pre-loaded to the ipads such as
      iready and solve me mobiles to cater to people with different intelligences. This is helpful because it is a retreat
      away from class and towards something they feel comfortable with. Another feature of the classroom is the desks.

    <p>The desks are spaced out and private like cubicles but with enough flexibility to fit the needs of any student.
      They feature a keyboard, engraved into the desk and a semi-circle round like design with much space for anything
      the student needs to put on the desk. On the right side is a full-size whiteboard for the students to be more
      productive during class while capturing and conveniently displaying their work on the teacher’s computer. The
      built-in keyboards are connected to the right display for students to share their questions about the lesson or
      answers to a question. The convenient button next to the keyboard allows them to submit their work to the display.
      Christopher has a hard time figuring out emotions, seeing what people were feeling just by looking at their face.
      He also has a hard time expressing his emotions and thoughts; “Then he drew some other pictures” … “but I was unable
      to say what those meant” (Haddon 3). Students like Christopher may be great at doing their work but they have trouble
      sharing it. This allows them to do and share their hard work without raising their hand to speak. This is also
      convenient because it lets everyone share their work at the same time effortlessly and anonymously if needed. Things
      change when things are designed for the norm, they only benefit a small number of people and if we keep doing this,
      it will be harder and harder to escape the enormous hole that we have dug ourselves into as a society.

    <p>Usually, when these spaces are designed, they are intended for neurotypical people that have an easy time
      adjusting to their environment. We designed this classroom intended for anyone who may want to use it, both
      neurotypical and not. Along with the strengths corner and semi-circle desks, there are many other things in the
      room that would enhance anyone's learning environment. It is very important to build spaces with all kinds of
      people in mind, not just for them but for everyone. These spaces should not just be one-time things that we forget
      about, they benefit everyone, no matter what they excel in or fall behind on.
