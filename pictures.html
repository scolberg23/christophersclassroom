      <p>The built-in movie theatre is a great place for media consumption and privacy if a student would like time
        alone but to still listen in on the lesson that is actively streaming to the theatre.</p>

      <p>The desks are spaced out and private like cubicles but with enough flexibility to fit the needs of any student.
        They feature a keyboard, engraved into the desk and a semi-circle round like design with much space for anything
        the student needs to put on the desk.

      <p>One of the features of the room is a corner where the students can practice their work, improving their
        strengths. This can be anything from math to English to language. For math, the corner has ipads with multiple
        math practice apps such as solve me mobiles and i-ready. The built-in fish tank and beanbag chairs are made
        purposefully to make the space more comfortable for anyone.
